# CMPS 6610  Lab 01

In this recitation, we will investigate asymptotic complexity. 

Some prompts will require you to edit `main.py` and others will require answers will go in `answers.md`.

Refer back to the [README.md](README.md) for instruction on git, how to test your code, and how to submit properly to get all the points you've earned.

## Comparing search algorithms

In this lab, we'll compare the running times of `linear_search` and `binary_search` empirically.

1. In `main.py`, the implementation of `linear_search` is already complete. Your task is to implement `binary_search`. Implement a recursive solution using the helper function `_binary_search`. 

2. Test that your function is correct by calling from the command-line `pytest main.py::test_binary_search`

3. Write at least two additional test cases in `test_binary_search` and confirm they pass.

4. Describe the worst case input value of `key` for `linear_search`? for `binary_search`?

5. Describe the best case input value of `key` for `linear_search`? for `binary_search`?

6. Complete the `time_search` function to compute the running time of a search function. Note that this is an example of a "higher order" function, since one of its parameters is another function.

7. Complete the `compare_search` function to compare the running times of linear search and binary search. Confirm the implementation by running `pytest main.py::test_compare_search`, which contains some simple checks.

8. Call `print_results(compare_search())` and paste the results here:

9. The theoretical worst-case running time of linear search is $O(n)$ and binary search is $O(\log_2 n)$. Do these theoretical running times match your empirical results? Why or why not?

10. Binary search assumes the input list is already sorted. Assume it takes $\Theta(n^2)$ time to sort a list of length $n$. Suppose you know ahead of time that you will search the same list $k$ times.

      **Enter your answer in answers.md**
  + For what values of $k$ is it more efficient to first sort and then use binary search versus just using linear search without sorting?
